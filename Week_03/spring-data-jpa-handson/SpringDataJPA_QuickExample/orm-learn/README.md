# Spring Data JPA - Quick Example (Hands-on 1)

## At first, I did this hands-on using Spring Boot 2.7.x as mentioned in the question, with:
- `javax.persistence`
- `MySQL5Dialect`

## But later, my Primary Contact from Cognizant told me to  
### "Please use the latest version and update accordingly."

So I updated it to:
- Spring Boot 3.x
- `jakarta.persistence`
- `MySQLDialect`

Everything else is same as the question asked.
