## This week, I worked on Microservices.
### Creating Microservices for account and loan:
- Created two separate Spring Boot microservices: "account" and "loan".
- Each service runs independently with its own REST controller.
### Create Eureka Discovery Server and register microservice:
- Set up a Eureka Discovery Server on port 8761.
- Registered both "account" and "loan" services with Eureka for discovery.



## Created by Soumyadip Karan for the Digital Nurture 4.0 Java FSE program.
