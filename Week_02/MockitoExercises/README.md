# Mockito Exercises

## Mandatory Hands-On

1. **Mocking and Stubbing**
   - Created a mock object for an external API.
   - Stubbed a method to return fixed test data.

2. **Verifying Interactions**
   - Checked if a method was called with specific arguments.

## Extra (Outside Mandatory Hands-On)

3. **Argument Matching**
   - Used matchers like `eq()` and `any()` to check method parameters.

4. **Handling Void Methods**
   - Verified that a `void` method was called correctly.

5. **Multiple Return Values**
   - Stubbed a method to return different results on each call using `thenReturn()`.
