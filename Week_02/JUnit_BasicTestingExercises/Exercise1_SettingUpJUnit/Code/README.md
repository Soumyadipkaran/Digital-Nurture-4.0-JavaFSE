This exercise demonstrates how to set up JUnit in a Java project using Maven.

## Objective

Set up JUnit in a new Java project and run a basic test to confirm the setup works correctly.

## What I did

1. Created a Maven project using IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Added JUnit 4.13.2 as a test dependency in the `pom.xml` file.
3. Created a test class named `MyFirstTest` in the appropriate package.
4. Wrote a simple test method that prints a message.
5. Ran the test to verify the setup.
