## Exercise 3: Assertions in JUnit

## Objective
Use various JUnit assertions to validate different test scenarios and verify expected results.

## What I did
1. Created a test class named `AssertionsTest` in the appropriate package.
2. Wrote a test method `testAssertions()` to demonstrate different types of assertions available in JUnit.
3. Used assertions like `assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertFalse`, `assertNull`, and `assertNotNull` to validate conditions.
4. Ran the test to confirm all assertions passed successfully.
