# Exercise 3: Sorting Customer Orders

This program sorts customer orders based on their total_price.

## What It Does

- Defines an `Order` class with:
  - `orderId`, `customerName`, and `totalPrice`
- Sorts orders using:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Displays sorted results after each method

## Sorting Algorithms Used

- **Bubble Sort**  
  Simple comparison-based sorting with O(nÂ²) time complexity.

- **Quick Sort**  
  Faster divide-and-conquer algorithm.  
  Uses the first element as pivot.  
  Average case: O(n log n)
