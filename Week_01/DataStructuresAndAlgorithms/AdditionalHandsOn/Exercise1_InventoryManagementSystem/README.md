# Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

This exercise implements a basic inventory management system using Java.

## What It Does

- Defines a `Product` class with:
  - `productId`, `productName`, `quantity`, and `price`
- Uses a `HashMap` to store products using `productId` as the key
- Adds two products to the inventory
- Displays the initial inventory
- Updates the quantity and price of a product
- Displays the inventory again after the update

## Why HashMap?

- Provides fast access using `productId`
- Allows quick update and delete operations

## Sample Operations

- Add product
- Update product details
- Display inventory before and after update
